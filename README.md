## Quran Radio

This is a simple and elegant Quran player solely built for the purpose of listening to Quran, that's it. To be able to simply hit a URL and start listening to Quran is what the main purpose of building this application is.If you find it useful, please feel free to drop me a message. *It is a work in progress. I recommend checking the app on Google Chrome on Desktop.*

## Features
The recitation is only in Arabic by Mishari Alafasi. 

## Contributions
The app is built on React, Vite, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS. You can fork this repository and make you contributions. 

## Major Thanks
Beyond many inspirations, I am thankful particularly to [Fuma Nama](https://github.com/fuma-nama) for helping me build this application, and [Quran.com API](https://github.com/quran/quran.com-api) for providing the API for Audio.
